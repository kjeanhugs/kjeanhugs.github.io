            <h2>Step 1: Create a GitHub account</h2>
            <p>If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account by visiting <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and clicking on "Sign up".</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Create a new repository</h2>
            <p>Once you've logged in to GitHub, create a new repository by clicking on the "+" icon in the top right corner and selecting "New repository". Give your repository a name in the format "username.github.io", where "username" is your GitHub username.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Clone the repository to your local machine</h2>
            <p>Use the "Clone or download" button to copy the repository's URL, and then open a terminal and run the command "git clone repository_url", where "repository_url" is the URL you just copied.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 4: Add your website files to the repository</h2>
            <p>Copy the files for your website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into the repository's root directory. You can use your code editor or the command line to do this.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 5: Commit and push your changes</h2>
            <p>In the terminal, navigate to the repository's root directory and run the following commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"git add ."</li>
                <li>"git commit -m 'Initial commit'"</li>
                <li>"git push origin master"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This will upload your website files to GitHub.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 6: View your website</h2>
            <p>Your website should now be live at "https://username.github.io", where "username" is your GitHub username.</p>
